# Movie Database Built with React

## Description

This project was built using React and the Movie Database API. It shows the most popular, top rated, and upcoming movies. It features a carousel on the home page that shows the most popular movies and shows various details for selected movies. In the future I want to add a search feature.

The site is hosted on Netlify and can be found [here](https://movies.mharb.tech/).

## Features

- Use arrays, objects, sets or maps to store and retrieve information that is displayed in your app.
- Analyze data that is stored in arrays, objects, sets or maps and display information about it in your app.
- Develop your project using a common JavaScript framework such as React, Angular, or Vue.

- Retrieve data from a third-party API and use it to display something within your app.

## How to run this project

Node.js and NPM are required to run this project.

To install the dependencies and start the project, run the following commands:

```
npm install
npm start
```

## API Key

This application uses the [The Movie Database API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction). You will need to create an account and request an API key. Once you have the key, create a file called `.env` in the root directory of the project and add the following line, with your API key:

```
REACT_APP_API_KEY=
```
